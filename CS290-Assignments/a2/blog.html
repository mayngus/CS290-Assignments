	<li>There was little to no troubles I had when completitng this assignment. I looked at the notes I took during lecture and I had exactly what I needed to complete this assignment. The only issue I had was figuring out how to implement an image. I solved that by doing a quick and easy google search.</li>
	<li>I learned the basic concepts of implementing a html page. I knew very little coming into this class/assignment, but I did know that every command comes with a similar ending one only with a '/' at the beginning.</li>
	<li>As I previously stated I used my notes that I took during lecture which gave me the basic structure on html. I then had to use google to figure out how to implement an image into my html file.</li>
      </ul>

	<li>There was not a lot of challenges with this assignment. The main problem I had was getting the text boxes in the filter container and the header title in their correct places. I fixed this with tedious increments of changing the widths for the text boxes and the position for the header title. </li>
	<li>I learned a lot from this assignment. Using hover effects and using flex boxes was the biggest thing I learned. It was very interesting and cool seeing how I could chamge the page to act responsively.</li>
	<li>The biggest help was stackoverflow. Whenever I had to simple or specific question stackoverflow was there to help with the exact answers to my problems.</li>
	<li>I had to look up how to keep a picture in size of a div. I was changing the size of the divs thinking that was going to change the size of the image too but that did not work and I was confused. I then googled this problem and it was a very simple solution that I had to change the size of the img tag itself and not the div class. </li>
