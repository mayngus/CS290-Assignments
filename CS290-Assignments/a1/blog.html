	<li>There was little to no troubles I had when completitng this assignment. I looked at the notes I took during lecture and I had exactly what I needed to complete this assignment. The only issue I had was figuring out how to implement an image. I solved that by doing a quick and easy google search.</li>
	<li>I learned the basic concepts of implementing a html page. I knew very little coming into this class/assignment, but I did know that every command comes with a similar ending one only with a '/' at the beginning.</li>
	<li>As I previously stated I used my notes that I took during lecture which gave me the basic structure on html. I then had to use google to figure out how to implement an image into my html file.</li>
